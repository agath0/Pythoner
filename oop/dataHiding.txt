DATA HIDING

Some languages implement data hiding by declaring data
or methods in a class as private or public
Private data and methods can be acessed only by 
methods inside the class
Public data and methods can be acessed  by 
methods outside the class
EXAMPLE:In a car you have access to steerin and breaks
	you dont need access to all the parts of the car
	that make your car move and stop.
	All internal details are best left to the
	creator of the car
	If you have access to internalls you may unknowingly
	do something that leads to car not working

The part visible to the user(public)is the interface of 
the class and the part which is (private) is the implementation

The interface of the class comes with the guarantee that it
will not change with time
But implementation may be changed without any warning.
This changes may be made to fix some bugs or to change
some functionality and improve efficiency

In python there is no such concept as private or public

In python everythng inside the class in public

Python doesnot enforce any restrictions on data and method
like java and cpp do
However there is a naming convention that specify that a 
certain attribute is meant ot be used inside the class only.
   leading undersore _data1
		     _data2
		     _method1
the leaing underscore mean that the data or method is 
meant to be private and should not be used outside the class.
However you cant restrict the user fromm accesing this varible
this variables can be accessed from outside the class to 
just like any other variables.

If you prefiz a name with __,python willdo some name mangling
--vlaue_
__value
this name mangling mechanisme makes it difficult for the user
to access the variables,but the actual purpose of this is
to make the name specific to the  class so that there is 
no name clash with subclasses

Names that start and end with two underscors like __init__
are used by python for its internal use

class_ ,range_ etcc can be used to avoid name clashes in program



NEED OF DISTINCTION BETWEEN PRIVATE AND PUBLIC WHEN
WORKING WITH A CLASS
--the users of a class are generally called clients and
  the client code uses the class by instantiating it
  that is by creating its objects
